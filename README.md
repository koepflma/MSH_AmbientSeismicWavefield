# Code belonging to: "Examining 22 Years of Ambient Seismic Wavefield at Mount St. Helens"

## Feature extraction
This github repository provides the code to extract the following features:
- Statistical Features: root-mean-square (RMS), root-median-square (RMeS), peak-ground-velocity (PGV), and peak-ground-acceleration (PGA)
- Real-time Seismic Amplitude Measurement (RSAM)
- Displacement Seismic Amplitude Ratio (DSAR)
- Scattering Coefficients & clustering (adapted from: [scatseisnet](https://scatseisnet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/))
- Spectral width (covariance, adapted from [covseisnet](https://covseisnet.gricad-pages.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/covseisnet/))
- z-score normalization

## Example
Beside the code used for the feature extraction, some example jupyter notebooks help producing some basic figures.
